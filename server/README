# server Folder

this is backend of the application which is made with node + express and mongoDB Atlas

lets first look at the folder we are working with:

```bash
server/
├── controllers/    → core functnality and bussiness logic (Controller)
└── helpers/        → cloud service (e.g cloudinary, paypal)
└── middleware/     → auth middleware
└── models/         → mongoDB documents Schema's (Model)
└── routes/         → all router for different services (View)
└── uploads/        → an queue folder to upload file into the cloud
└── server.js       → starting file for server (index.js or app.js)
└── .env            → to make one take reference of .env.example
```

as you can see we are following MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for our backend

to run the backend of our app run: 
```bash 
npm run dev
```
